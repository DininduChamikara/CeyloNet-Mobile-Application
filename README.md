# CeyloNet-Mobile-Application
Project for second year first semester INCO competition. Group - Anonymous Krypton 

This project is about a new mobile application to connect SME's and Buyers. 
By using this mobile application,
  Sellers able to promote their products or services to customers
  and buyers able to contact sellers to fulfill their requirements. 
  Very important feature of this app is buyers also able to publish their 
  requirements through this mobile app. 

I used Firebase databases for this mobile application.
